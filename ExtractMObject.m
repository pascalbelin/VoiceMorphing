% This function will directly compute the source-filter decomposition of a sound.
% It needs user intervention at two stages:
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A) Fundamental frequency (F0) detection

% A time-frequency graph will be displayed, showing the different F0 candidates for each time sample
% The candidates that were selected by the automatic procedure will be highlighted in green.
% If the result of this automatic F0 detection looks correct, without unnecessary interruptions,
% then press Esc. to go to the next processing step.
%
% Otherwise, if the result of the automatic F0 detection looks unsatisfying, click on the figure.
% You now have to define a lower and upper frequency boundaries which will constrain the F0 search range.
% First define the lower boundary, clicking with the left button to add landmarks and with the right button
% to finish the boundary definition. Then do the same for the upper frequency boundary. Matlab will restart
% the F0 detection process, taking into account the frequency constraints you manually defined.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% B) Time and frequency anchors definition
%
% Defining accurately time and frequency anchors is of crucial importance for high-quality morphing.
% Time anchors usually indicate beginning and end of the sound, phoneme temporal boundaries and
% also important formant transition. Frequency anchors usually indicate formant central frequencies.
% The number of time axes should match for all sounds that will be morphed together. The number of frequency
% anchors can be different for different time axes; yet for each time axis, the number of frequency anchors
% has to be consistent across all the sounds.
% 
% First define a time axis by clicking with the right mouse button at the appropriate temporal location.
% Then define frequency anchors on this time axis by clicking with the left button. Click on the right mouse
% button to define a new time axis and press Enter to finish, or Esc. to start again.
