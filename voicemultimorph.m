% Voicemultimorph is designed to morph a virtually unlimited number of sounds together.
% All the sounds are processed in a symmetrical way, without any intermediate morphing stages.
%
% 1st parameter mObjects is a cell array of structures containing all the mObjects of the sounds you want to morph.
% 2nd parameter mRates is a structure with 5 fields, each of them being a vector with as many elements as sounds :
%  .F0                : morphing rates vector for fundamental frequency
%  .spectralamplitude : morphing rates vector for spectral amplitude
%  .aperiodicity      : morphing rates vector for aperiodicity index
%  .time              : morphing rates vector for time structure
%  .frequency         : morphing rates vector for frequency structure and formants
%
% Different mRates can be applied for the different sounds or fields.
%
% Default settings are:
% - linear interpolations for time frames
% - logarithmic interpolations for frequency frames
% - logarithmic interpolations for F0
% - logarithmic interpolations for spectral amplitudes
% - linear interpolations for aperiodicity indexes (which are on a dB scale)
